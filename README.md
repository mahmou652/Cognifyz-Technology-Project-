Invwstment Analysis
Data Visualization Internship with Cognifyz Technologies!

Over the past few days, Iâ€™ve worked on six tasks covering:
âœ” Gender distribution analysis
âœ” Investment behavior and preferences
âœ” Savings objectives and information sources
âœ” Investment durations and expectations
âœ” Correlation analysis between key financial variables
âœ” A full interactive dashboard built using Microsoft Excel
